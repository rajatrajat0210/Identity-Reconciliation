# Identity Reconciliation API

This project is a Flask-based REST API designed to reconcile identity information based on emails and phone numbers. It exposes a single endpoint **`/identify`** which accepts JSON requests and returns a consolidated view of contact details, grouping primary and secondary contacts.

---

## How It Works

- The API accepts a JSON payload containing an email and/or phone number.
- It searches the database for existing contacts matching the given email or phone.
- If no contact exists, it creates a new primary contact.
- If matches exist, it collects all related contacts linked by their IDs (primary and secondary).
- It consolidates emails, phone numbers, and secondary contact IDs associated with the primary contact.
- If the incoming email or phone is new, it adds a new secondary contact linked to the primary contact.
- The response returns the **primaryContactId**, all associated emails, phone numbers, and a list of secondary contact IDs.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3** â€” Programming language
- **Flask** â€” Web framework for building the API
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** â€” ORM for database interaction
- **SQLite** â€” Lightweight database used for development and testing
- **Gunicorn** â€” WSGI HTTP server for production deployment
- **Render.com** â€” Hosting and deployment platform

ðŸ“¬ Postman Collection
ðŸ§ª We've prepared a full Postman collection with all the test cases for validating the /identify endpoint.

âœ… Includes:

New primary contact creation

Linking new secondary contact

Merging two primaries

All valid combinations of email and phoneNumber (email only, phone only, both)

ðŸ“Œ How to Use:

Open the link above in Postman.

Import the collection into your workspace.

Run the test cases using the Postman runner or manually.
